# ProKit - Project Management App

## Introduction

ProKit is a React Expo application designed to help users effectively manage their projects. It provides a centralized platform for creating, organizing, and accessing projects, along with the ability to integrate preferred tools. 

**Key Features:**

* **Project Creation:** Easily create and manage projects.
* **Tool Integration:** Add your favorite tools and services to streamline workflows.
* **Quick Access:** Quickly access recent and important projects.
* **User Authentication:** Secure login, registration, and password reset functionalities.
* **Dark/Light Mode Support:** Choose between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.

**Current Status:**

ProKit is currently in active development. An initial prototype with core screens (Login/Register, Reset Password, Home) has been developed, along with dark and light mode support. Screen designs are finalized and available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CO7LIBbLZPPOlP4cvtBrr8WZoi5A3fbr?usp=drive_link).

**Future Development:**

We are working on implementing backend logic, navigation between screens, project management features, tool integration, and thorough testing and refinement based on user feedback.

**Stay Tuned!**

We are excited about the potential of ProKit to simplify project management and look forward to sharing updates as we progress.
